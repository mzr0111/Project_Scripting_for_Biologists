# Title: Identification of novel SNPs associated with breast cancer using WGS data
## Introduction: 
Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with diverse genetic alterations contributing to its development and progression. With advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants associated with breast cancer. WGS allows for a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the entire genome, providing detailed insights into the genomic landscape of breast cancer.

In this project, I utilized WGS data to identify genetic variants in breast cancer samples using Genomic Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) best practices. Variant calling is a critical step in the analysis of WGS data, where the goal is to identify DNA sequence changes, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (indels), that may underlie breast cancer pathogenesis. By applying haplotype caller to breast cancer WGS data, I aimed to comprehensively characterize the spectrum of genetic variants in the genome, which may contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer development and progression.
